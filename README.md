# JobStorm

Are you trying to figure out what company or where geographically you might want to work for, but donâ€™t want to go through all that hassle searching the web. Well than Job Storm is the app for you! 

Just type in the company name or type of career and Job Storm will generate the most recent review from current employees and company ratings.

This application uses jQuery, jQueryUI, HTML5, CSS3, and utilizes the glassdoor API to pull JSON data to generate employee responses and rating. It also uses the google map API to generate job opportunities in different locations.
